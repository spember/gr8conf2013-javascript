# Fundamentals of Responsive Single Page Web Applications
## gr8conf US 2013

This a presentation and small sample application I am writing / put together for a talk I gave / am giving at gr8conf US. It covers several key pieces of building a Single Page Web Application, some advantages of using Grails as the server portion, and 9 key programming concepts to be aware of when using the fancy JS frameworks.

## Requirements:
Grails 2.2.3

## The Slides

The slides were written using [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). There is a pdf at the root level of this repository, but if you'd like to view them 'native', run this app and go "localhost:${port}"

In addition, there is a trivial sample app that demonstrates the normal browsing vs Single Page App approach which can be accessed by viewing the /recordStore or /recordStore/spa endpoints
